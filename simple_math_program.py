### exercise

january_to_june_rainfall = 1.93 + 0.71 + 3.53 + 3.41 + 3.69 + 4.50
annual_rainfall = january_to_june_rainfall

july_rainfall = 1.05
annual_rainfall += july_rainfall

august_rainfall = 4.91
annual_rainfall += august_rainfall

september_rainfall = 5.16
october_rainfall = 7.20
november_rainfall = 5.06
december_rainfall = 4.06


### 
cucumbers = 100

num_people = 6

whole_cucumbers_per_person = cucumbers / num_people

print whole_cucumbers_per_person

## results in 16

float_cucumbers_per_person = float(cucumbers) / float(num_people)

print float_cucumbers_per_person


## results in 16.66666666667
